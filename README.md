# Dotos App - Create React App Starter

This project is a Dotos (To-Do List) application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Below are instructions for getting started and managing the app.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

3. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can use the following scripts:

### `npm start`

Run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload on changes, and lint errors may appear in the console.

### `npm test`

Launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information on running tests, refer to the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Build the app for production to the `build` folder. It optimizes the build for performance, and the app is ready for deployment. See the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies into your project for full control.

Remember, you don't have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments. You can customize it when you're ready.
